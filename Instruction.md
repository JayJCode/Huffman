You can write something, you want to encrypt in text file - original.txt.

Then just simply start the program, everything is already set up.

In encrypted.txt you can find:

1st line - the number of zeros that was added to make it byte notation.

2nd part is the dictionary part, also needed to decrypt the file.

3rd and the last part is unreadable byte notation of original text. 

In decrypted.txt you can find the decrypted encrypted.txt file content :)

Theoretically it should be the same as the origin one.

But if not, then in console there will be a proper message! ;)

Hope you liked it!
